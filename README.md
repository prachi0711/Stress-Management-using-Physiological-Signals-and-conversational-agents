# Stress Management using Physiological Signals and Conversational Agents

Stress is a common issue that significantly impacts mental and physical health, often diminishing overall well-being and productivity. Effective stress management
is crucial, yet many individuals struggle to recognize or address their stress levels in a timely manner. Advances in technology, particularly artificial intelligence
(AI), offer promising solutions by leveraging physiological signals to detect and mitigate stress in real time. This project explores an AI-based approach to stress
management by analyzing physiological indicators such as heart rate and skin conductance, enabling early intervention through personalized, interactive support.

Physiological signals: measurements of biological functions such as heart rate, skin conductance, and brain activity; provide direct insight into how the body responds to stressors. A key innovation of this system is its integration of physiological monitoring with conversational interaction facilitated by a companion robot. Unlike traditional methods that rely on self-reported assessments, physiological signals provide continuous, objective, and involuntary measurements of stress responses, making them more reliable and difficult to manipulate. These signals reflect the bodyâ€™s dynamic reactions to stressors, allowing for tailored stress-relief strategies based on individual needs.

This project leverages physiological signals (e.g., IBI from BVP, EDA) from the **WESAD** dataset to detect stress levels in real time. An AI pipeline classifies stress, quantifies prediction uncertainty, and triggers personalized interventions via a dialogue system.

# **Workflow Summary**  

  Data Collection: Use the WESAD dataset (BVP and EDA signals) for stress detection.

  Preprocessing: Filter noise, normalize, and extract features (e.g., IBI peaks, EDA).

  Stress Classification: Train a model (Random Forest/1D CNN) to predict stress.

  Uncertainty Quantification (UQ): Compute confidence scores (entropy) to assess prediction reliability.

  Decision Logic:

  - Low uncertainty: Proceed with predicted stress level.

  - High uncertainty: Prompt user for feedback (e.g., "How are you feeling?").

  Dialogue Management: Generate context-aware responses (e.g., breathing exercises for stress).

# **Environment Setup**

### Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```
python -m venv .venv
```
Activate the virtual environment:

Linux/macOS:
   ```
   source .venv/bin/activate
```

Windows:

    .\.venv\Scripts\activate
    
### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install necessary libraries like neurokit2, requests, and others.
