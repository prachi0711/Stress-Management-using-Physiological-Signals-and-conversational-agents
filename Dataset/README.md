## **Dataset: WESAD (Wearable Stress and Affect Detection)** 
This dataset is a publicly available dataset, which can be downloaded from here [WESAD Dataset](https://ubi29.informatik.uni-siegen.de/usi/data_wesad.html).

### **Key Features**  
- **Modalities**: ECG, EDA (GSR), BVP, ACC, RESP, EMG (sampled at 4â€“64 Hz).  
- **Subjects**: 15 usable subjects (2 discarded) with lab-induced stress.  
- **Study Environment**: Laboratory.
- **Ground Truth Labels:** 1 = Baseline (neutral state); 2 = Stress (induced stress); 3 = Amusement (positive affect).

For this Project, EDA and BVP signals are used which are collected from E4 wearable sensor.

| Signal | Description | Sampling Rate | Sensor | Relevance to Stress |  
|--------|-------------|--------------|--------|---------------------|  
| **EDA** (Electrodermal Activity) | Measures skin conductance (sweat gland activity). | **4 Hz** | Empatica E4 wristband | Direct indicator of sympathetic nervous system arousal (higher EDA = stress). |  
| **BVP** (Blood Volume Pulse) | Tracks blood flow changes (used to derive HR/HRV). | **64 Hz** | Empatica E4 wristband | Heart rate variability (HRV) decreases under stress. |  


### **Stress Level Segmentation**  
To deal with stress data, Label 2 is extracted from the dataset and is then further used for preprocesssing. Label 1 is extracted and used as a non-stress. 

### **Validation Approach**  
- **Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO)**: Model trained on 14 subjects, tested on the held-out subject.  

### **Ground Truth**  
- **Self-reports**: Validated via STAI (anxiety) and SSSQ (stress) questionnaires.
